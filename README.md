Hello,
this is an infix->RPN converter used in a command line.
In order to use it you need GNU-make, because you need to compile this project on your own. This project works onlu with basic operands: '+', '-', 'x', '/' and in order to use it you need to seperete every symbol with a space. 
This project is still untested.
I will consider adding possibility to have more complex operators and functions. 
I implemented my own stack-like data structure because i wanted to.
Thanks for watching.
